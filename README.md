##Coursework 3 for Birkbeck Programming in Java Module.

Interfaces that must be implemented are provided.

Launching a start-up company is difficult. Apart from creating a great 
product, you must talk to a lot of people to get them interested in 
the project: clients, venture capital, government agencies. . . it is 
really difficult to keep track of everybody! When is your next 
meeting? Who will you meet? What did they say the last time you
talked to them?

The purpose of this assignment it writing a program to keep track of 
contacts and meetings. The application will keep track of contacts, 
past and future meetings, etc. When the application is closed, all 
data must be stored in a text file called contacts.txt . This file 
must be read at startup to recover all data introduced in a former 
session (the format of the file is up to you: you can use XML, 
comma-separated values (CSV), or any other format).

###Notes

Since the supplied files are in the default package, and given that 
supplied files are to be considered overwritten, it is not possible 
to organise the tests in packages as the default package is not 
accessible from a class in another package.

Tests have been placed in the root alongside the classes to be tested.
